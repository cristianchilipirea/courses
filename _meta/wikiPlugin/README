This plugin is a modification for the iframe plugin for dokuwiki, developed by Christopher Smith <chris@jalakai.co.uk>. 
It is meant to add a secret key in the iframe url, based on the wiki username.
It is not meant for public used, but particular to our infrastructure, as such it is not published on the wiki plugins list.
